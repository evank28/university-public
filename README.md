A repo storing code written for class with permissions of the instructors.

## Directory List

### CSC148 - Introduction to Computer Science
**Course Description:**

> Abstract data types and data structures for implementing them.
> Linked data structures. Encapsulation and information-hiding.
> Object-oriented programming. Specifications. 
>Analyzing the efficiency of programs. Recursion.
> This course assumes programming experience as provided by CSC108H1.

*Note: I skipped CSC108, hence why it is missing from this repository*

**Folder Contents:**
- `test_group_hierarchy.py` &rarr; A collection of pytest test I wrote for an
 assignment in this course. I used Test Driven Design to write tests for a 
 complex class structure prior to starting on implementing the code.

 
 
##Academic Integrity
Before posting code in this repo, I recieved permission from the instructor.
I've also ensured that my code is not vulnerable to re-use, in case a student
with a similar assignment attempts to plagiarize my work in the future. I took 3
main precotions:

 - **Branches**: I use the `pseudo-master` branch as default to prevent this repo
from appearing in search results, for good measure.

- **Obfuscation**: All code in this repo has modified significantly to impede
re-use.
- **Partial Work**: I've only included small samples of the work from each
assignment, to prevent re-use.
